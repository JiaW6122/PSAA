# Collection and reorganization of MHC I and MHC II based antigen presentation pathway

Antigen processing is a fundamental mechanism within the immune system, wherein intact antigens undergo degradation, and resulting peptide fragments are loaded onto major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and then presented on the cell surface, facilitating recognition by T cells. Due to the different molecule structure, there are two kinds of MHC-MHC class I (recognized by CD8+) and MHC class II (recognized by CD4+). They can carry antigens from different recourses (MHC I mainly bind exogenous antigens while MHC II mainly bind endogenous antigens) and present them on the cell surface in totally different pathways. Although databases including the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Reactome and GO provide well-constructed antigen presentation pathway, we optimize the MHC class I and MHC class II antigen presentation pathways for systems biology-based antigen presentation level analysis because of the following reasons: (1) some databases construct antigen presentation pathway only using genes encoding MHC molecules and genes regulating peptides binding to MHC, but neglect other important modules in antigen presentation pathways, like proteasomal degradation of cytosolic proteins, Peptides being further trimmed in ER, MHC-I-peptide complexes transferring through Golgi to cell surface and recycling. (2) Others construct network in high complexity with repeated genes in different modules, which is unfeasible for flux computation. In SAA, we first manually collected, curated, and reconstructed the biological processes that are involved in the MHC class I and II antigen presentation pathway via integrating pathway annotations in GO, KEGG and Reactome databases and an extensive literature set.

The MHC class I antigen presentation pathway encompasses a series of intricate biological processes. These include ubiquitination, proteasomal degradation, the action of the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), chaperone-assisted assembly of the MHC class I complex, transit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus, and subsequent exocytosis from the Golgi to the cell membrane. Additionally, auxiliary pathways such as de-ubiquitination, verification of MHC class I complex integrity, and salvage through endocytosis are also added as branches in this pathway. The final MHC class I antigen presentation pathway covers 284 genes of 8 modules.

The MHC class II antigen presentation pathway involves modules like uptake of extracellular proteins into cell, processing of internalized proteins in endosomal/lysosomal, biosynthesis of MHC2 in ER, transport of MHC2 from ER to Golgi, transport of MHC2 from Golgi to Endosomes, association of MHC2 with antigen, expression of Peptide MHC2 Complex to cell surface. The final MHC class II antigen presentation pathway covers 124 genes of 7 modules.

Complete list of genes and modules of the MHC class I and MHC class II antigen presentation pathways is given in Table 1 and Table 2.
